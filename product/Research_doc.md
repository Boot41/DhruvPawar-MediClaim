# MedClaim AI Validator – Research Document

## 1. Introduction
The health insurance industry relies on accurate and efficient claims processing. Traditional review methods involve manual verification of lengthy, multi-format documents, often resulting in high turnaround times, errors, and compliance risks. 

MedClaim AI Validator is an open-source tool designed to automate document understanding, summarization, and compliance checking for health insurance claims. 

Unlike commercial LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini, which struggle with long multi-document context, structured validation, and explainability, this system integrates AI with domain rules to produce reliable, auditable results.

## 2. Problem Statement
- **Manual Review Bottlenecks:** Claims processing can take days or weeks due to human-intensive review.
- **Complex Document Types:** Claims may include PDFs, scanned images, medical codes, and unstructured forms.
- **Contextual Cross-Referencing:** Validation requires comparing multiple documents against policy rules.
- **Compliance & Traceability:** Regulatory standards demand explainable, auditable outputs – not just text summaries.

---

## 3. Why This Project?
- **Efficiency:** Automate document extraction, summarization, and policy cross-checking to reduce turnaround time.
- **Accuracy:** Use domain-specific validation instead of general text generation.
- **Explainability:** Provide structured, traceable, compliance-ready outputs.
- **Open-Source Advantage:** Build on open models and libraries, ensuring cost-effectiveness and transparency.

## 4. Flow of the System
1. **Document Ingestion**
   - Upload multi-page PDFs, scans, or text files.
   - Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for scanned documents.

2. **Information Extraction**
   - Extract patient details, medical procedures, diagnosis codes (ICD, CPT), claim amounts.

3. **Context-Aware Summarization**
   - Summarize findings per document and across the case.

4. **Cross-Referencing with Policy**
   - Validate against insurer's policy database or uploaded rule sets.

5. **Risk & Gap Identification**
   - Highlight missing documentation, inconsistencies, or fraud risks.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Verification**
   - Reviewer edits or approves AI-generated findings before final submission.

7. **Final Structured Output**
   - Compliance-ready report for insurance teams.
